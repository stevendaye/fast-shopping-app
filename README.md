# Fast Shopping App | Sancrisoft Skills Test
Fast Shopping is a simple application platform that allows vistors to order their products online. The basic idea is to build a page that list different purchasable products on the homepage.

Users can select their products which will be added to their shopping cart. The cart should then contains all items the user added to complete the order. The shopping cart should allow the user to increment the quatity of each product, display each price and the subtotal. Once the order made, a Thank You page must be returned.

Once order is made, the user is to be redirected to a page to fill in his personal information and location for delivery. However, if the user is an existing user, the app should remember a him by displaying his old information. The user must also be able to sort each product by **Alpha Order**, **Lower Price** and Most **Recent**.

While the codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/stevendaye/fast-shopping-app, the online app can be viewed in production at https://the-fast-shopping-app.herokupapp.com.
